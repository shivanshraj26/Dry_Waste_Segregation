Problem Statement:
Our college and hostel facilities generate a substantial volume of waste daily, including paper, glass, cardboard, metal, plastic, and miscellaneous items.
Current Waste Management: The existing waste management system offers only two disposal options: wet and dry bins. However, the system lacks the capability to efficiently segregate dry waste into its constituent materials.

Proposed Solution:
We are making an IOT based model using Raspberry PI which segregates given objects into one of the following:
*Plastic
*Paper
*Cardboard
*Metal
*Glass

This can be used to segregate dry waste on a conveyor belt w/o human intervention from a centralized control center.

Tech Stack used and implemented:
Raspberry Pi 3
Picamera
Python Libraries(Tensorflow, Keras)
CNN(Convolution Neural Network)
StreamLit
Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network LibraryÂ (oneDNN)
